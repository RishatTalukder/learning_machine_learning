    "Neural Networks are the building blocks of Deep Learning. They are a the entry point to the world of Artificial Intelligence. Neural Networks are inspired by the human brain and are designed to simulate the way that humans learn but in a mathematical way. In this article, we will learn about the basics of Neural Networks, how they work, and how they are trained and how you can do it using Python.\n",

    "`Neural Networks` are a set of `algorithms`, `modeled loosely` after the `human brain`, that are designed to `recognize patterns`. They `interpret sensory data` through a kind of `machine perception`, `labeling`, or `clustering` of raw input. The patterns they recognize are `numerical` and contained in `vectors`, into which all real-world data (images, sound, text, etc.) must be `translated`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Neural Networks` help us `cluster` and `classify`. You can think of them as a `cluster of data` that can be trained to `recognize patterns`. They can be used to `model complex patterns` and `prediction problems` that are `non-linear` in nature.\n",
