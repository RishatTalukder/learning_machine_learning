    "KNN is a `popular` algorithm used for both classification and regression and I tried my best to explain it in this artcle. I regularly write these type of article explaining machine learning algorithms and concepts and other stuffs related to programming. So, if you are interested in reading more of these, you can follow me on `linkedin`(https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-rishat-talukder-a22157239/)\n",

    "I also have a `youtube` channel where I post videos on programming and machine learning. So, if you are interested in watching those, you can subscribe to my channel(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEEkKXpAkSwcMaIHnGi3Niw)\n",

    "\n",
    "So, let's get started with the article.\n",

    "# Introduction to KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "`k nearest neighbors` or `knn` is a `supervised` machine learning algorithm which is used for both `classification` and `regression`. It is a `non-parametric` algorithm which means it does not make any assumption on the underlying data distribution. It is also a `lazy` algorithm which means it does not learn anything in the training period. It just stores the training data and uses it to make predictions. It is also called a `memory-based` algorithm because it memorizes the training dataset. It is also called an `instance-based` algorithm because it uses the training dataset as the instance to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AAAANNNNNNDDDDD I can say that `ALL` this `FANCY` words are not going to make any sense to you if you are a beginner. So, let's break it down and understand what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "`KNN` is a `machine learning algorithm` mainly used for `classification` and `regression`. So, what is `classification` and `regression`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "`Classification` is a `supervised` machine learning algorithm which is used to `classify` data into different classes. For example, we have a dataset of `flowers` and we want to classify them into different classes. So, we can use `classification` algorithm to classify them into different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I'm assuming you know about `supervised` and `unsupervised` machine learning algorithms. If you don't know about them, you can check this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01tIRP_Rqs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "`Regression` is also a `supervised` machine learning algorithm which is used to `predict` a `continuous` value. For example, we have a dataset of `house prices` and we want to predict the `price` of a `house` based on the `features` of the `house`. So, we can use `regression` algorithm to predict the `price` of the `house`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `KNN` is a `supervised` machine learning algorithm which is used for both `classification` and `regression`. Meaning this algorithm can be used to classify data into different classes and also to predict a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will only focus on `classification` using `KNN` algorithm. So, let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How KNN works?\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually `KNN` is a very simple algorithm. It is based on the `distance` between the `data points`. And the name is actually explains the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "`KNN` stands for `K Nearest Neighbors`. So, what does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a dataset of `horse` vs `dog` and we want to classify them into different classes. So, we can use `KNN` algorithm to classify them into different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![horse vs dog](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*uwp-DjKCODYJnSnfaLZhYA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ">the red dots are `horse` and the blue dots are `dog` and the green dot is the `test data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this graph we can see that the `red dots` are `horse` and the `blue dots` are `dog`. And we have a `test data` which is the `green dot`. We can classify then preety easy by just looking at the graph. But the middle point is a bit confusing. We can't say for sure if it is a `horse` or a `dog`. Here comes the `KNN` algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calculate` the distance between the `test data` and all the `data points` in the `dataset`.\n",
    "- `sort` the `distances` in `ascending` order.\n",
    "- `select` the `top k` `data points` based on the `distance`.\n",
    "> `K` can be any number but it is usually an odd number. Because if we select an even number, we can get a `tie` between the `classes`. \n",
    "- `assign` the `class` based on the `majority` of the `top k` `data points`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning the if the `majority` of the `top k` `data points` are `horse`, then the `test data` is a `horse`. And if the `majority` of the `top k` `data points` are `dog`, then the `test data` is a `dog`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. That's how `KNN` algorithm works. It think it is pretty simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "![knn](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*8_4fzTQZJ0jNlWz9fjCqUw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a `visual` representation of the `KNN` algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As, you can see when `K = 3` the `test data` is classified as `class B` because After sorting the distance in `ascending` order the `top 3` `data points` are `2` `class B` and `1` `class A`. So, the `test data` is classified as `class B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if `K=5` the classification of the `test data` changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SO we can say that the `K` value is very important in `KNN` algorithm. It can change the classification of the `test data`. So, we have to choose the `K` value very carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://datascienceplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-78-490x215.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the you can see that as the `k` rises the Better the classification becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's how the `KNN` algorithm works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PROS and CONS of KNN\n",
    "\n",

    "- It is very important to choose the `K` value very carefully. Because it can change the classification of the `test data`.\n",
    "- Catetgorical features do not work well with `KNN` algorithm. We have to convert them into `numerical` features before using them in `KNN` algorithm.\n"
